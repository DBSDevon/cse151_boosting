		# A. Run our boost algorithm
		# B. Add the resulting tuple to our list
	# 4. Read the test file
	# 5. Create a variable for the total error and the total number of emails
	# 6. For each email in the test file
		# A. Label it according to our algorithm
		# B. Compare the labels, add to the error count if it fails

	# 7. Spit out the number for t and a fraction of error count / email count
