	# Vector of weights
	# 3. for t loops:
		# A. Run our boost algorithm (returns a tuple for our list and the new weights)
		# B. Add the resulting tuple to our list
		# C. Replace our current vector of weights with the new vector
	# 4. Read the test file
	# 5. Create a variable for the total error and the total number of emails
	# 6. For each email in the test file
		# A. Label it according to our algorithm
		# B. Compare the labels, add to the error count if it fails

	# 7. Spit out the number for t and a fraction of error count / email count for our personal gains
	# 8. load the dictionary into a vector
	# 9. for each tuple in our list
		# A. spit out the element of the vector in that spot
